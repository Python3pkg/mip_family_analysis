family.py

Holds the meta information of a family and its individuals.

    - has a Individual
    - has a Variant

Attributes:

individuals DICT dictionary with family members on the form {<ind_id>:<Individual_obj>}
variants DICT dictionary with all the variants that exists in the family on the form {<var_id>:<Variant_obj>}

    
Methods:

    - print_individuals
    - print_all_variants
    - add_variant(attach a variant objekt and also a variant id to individuals)
